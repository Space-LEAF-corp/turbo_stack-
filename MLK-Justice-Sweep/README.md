# MLK Justice Sweep – Turbo Stack Security Ritual

This project encodes an annual **MLK Jr. Day justice sweep** and a **daily integrity test** for systems that participate in the **Turbo Stack / Krystal Core Satellite Relay** network.

## Core concepts

- **AI sponge & validation sweep:**
  Forward analysis of logs, access patterns, and configuration changes.

- **Reverse algorithm anomaly detection:**
  Reverse-time reprocessing, looking for impossible sequences and hidden backdoors.

- **Infinity loop passes (0.2s / 0.25s):**
  Symbolic cadence for scheduling: two tightly coupled passes that converge into a single stream.

- **Reverse gyroscopic cataloging & indexing:**
  Multi-axis indexing (time, user, resource, device, anomaly score) for stability and later forensics.

- **Integrity vault:**
  Cryptographically chained evidence store, optionally anchored to **Turbo Stack Krystal Core satellites** to detect tampering.

- **JARVONDIS integration:**
  Final, normalized anomaly stream formatted for the JARVONDIS game engine / analytic core.

## Modes

- **Daily integrity test** – lightweight run over a recent time window.
- **MLK Justice Sweep** – deep annual run with full vault anchoring and report generation.

## Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Structure:** Modular components under `src/`
- **Config:** YAML files under `config/`
