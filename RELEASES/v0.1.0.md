## Summary

This release introduces the Krystal Core satellite specification package and a production-ready authentication starter for the Turbo Stack template.

This is a milestone release that collects the repository's first set of production-focused features, documentation, and tests.

## Highlights

- **Added** spec and test coverage for E_mag calculation, plasma frequency, safety checks, soft-start profiles, and quench simulation.
- **Improved** documentation: `AUTH_SYSTEM.md`, `K8S_ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `SHOWCASE.md` updated for portfolio and operational clarity.
- **Branding**: Homepage updated to **SPACE LEAF CORP** (teal title and space background) to reflect product positioning.
- **CI**: Added GitHub Actions workflow to run lint/tests/builds on `push` and `pull_request` to `main`.
